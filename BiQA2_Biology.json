Two recent studies, one examining Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the other Escherichia coli, clearly show TI at one promoter caused by the arrival of a transcribing complex initiating at a distant promoter. TI is potentially widespread throughout biology",

Gray and white matter tissue proportions were similar between the sexes globally. Regional tissue composition analysis showed sex differences within the parietal lobes with females having proportionately more gray matter on the right side. There were no differences between the sexes in cortical surface anatomy measures. Overall, against the background of similarity in morphology, there are differences between the sexes with regard to general and regional brain measures.

These deficits are particularly pronounced when reward information is uncertain or the task context requires flexible adaptations to changing stimulus-reward contingencies. Moreover, emerging evidence points to age-related differences in the sensitivity to rewarding and aversive outcomes during learning and decision making if the acquisition of behavior critically depends on outcome processing. These age-related asymmetries in outcome valuation may be explained by age differences in the interplay of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation.",

This is due to the C:C+ clamps on either end and extensive mismatches in the antiparallel orientation. The structure is stable at neutral and acidic pH. At higher temperatures, the duplex melts into single strands in a highly cooperative fashion. All adenine, cytosine and thymine nucleotides adopt the anti conformation with respect to the glycosidic bond. The A:T base pairs form reverse Watson-Crick base pairs.

While thyroid hormones are generally constant, we find that TRalpha and beta dramatically cycle, suggesting that fundamental concepts such as \"basal metabolism\" may require reexamination.

These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.",

These changes may result from adaptations to solar ultraviolet radiation (protection of sweat glands, sunburn, skin cancer, vitamin D deficiency, defence against microorganisms, etc.), and/or sexual selection. Migration to areas with high levels of UV is associated with skin darkening, while migration to areas with low levels has led to skin lightening. However, other factors may have played roles. Temperature and food have probably been secondary determinants: heat exchange with the environment is dependent on ambient temperature, and a high intake of food rich in vitamin D allows a dark skin color to persist even at latitudes of low UV levels, as exemplified by Inuit's living at high latitudes. Future studies of human migration will show if skin lightening is a faster process and has a higher evolutionary impact than skin darkening. Maybe due to that some American Indians have kept a relatively light skin although they live under the equator. The following hypotheses for skin darkening are reviewed: shielding of sweat glands and blood vessels in the skin, protection against skin cancer and overproduction of vitamin D, camouflage, adaptation to different ambient temperatures, defense against microorganisms, protection against folate photodestruction. Hypotheses for skin lightening are: sexual selection, adaptation to cold climates, enhancement of vitamin D photoproduction, and changing food habits leading to lower intake of vitamin D.",

We present a theory relating the coenocytic structure to the unusual electrophysiology of V. ventricosa. The alveolate cytoplasm of V. ventricosa consists of a collective of uninucleate cytoplasmic domains interconnected by fine cytoplasmic strands containing microtubules. The cytoplasm is capable of disassociating into single cytoplasmic domains or aggregations of domains that can regenerate new coenocytes. The cytoplasmic domains are enclosed by outer (apical) and inner (basolateral) faces of a communal membrane with polarised K(+)-transporting functions, stabilised by microtubules and resembling a tissue such as a polarised epithelium.",

The exception is 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.16) whose specific activity in brain mitochondria is 125 times lower than in heart mitochondria. The partially purified brain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase was shown to be catalytically and immunologically identical with the heart enzyme. The low rate of fatty acid oxidation in brain mitochondria, estimated on the basis of palmitoylcarnitine-supported respiration and [1-14C]palmitoylcarnitine degradation to be less than 0.5 nmol/min/mg of protein, may be the consequence of the low activity of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.",

Thus, in periods of extended continuous and rapid neuronal firing, fatty acid oxidation cannot guarantee rapid ATP generation in neurons. We conjecture that the disadvantages connected with using fatty acids as fuel have created evolutionary pressure on lowering the expression of the \u03b2-oxidation enzyme equipment in brain mitochondria to avoid extensive fatty acid oxidation and to favor glucose oxidation in brain.",

                    "text": "Intrinsically disordered protein is common across the three domains of life, but especially common among the eukaryotic proteomes. Signaling sequences and sites of posttranslational modifications are frequently, or very likely most often, located within regions of intrinsic disorder. Disorder-to-order transitions are coupled with the adoption of different structures with different partners. Also, the flexibility of intrinsic disorder helps different disordered regions to bind to a common binding site on a common partner. Such capacity for binding diversity plays important roles in both protein-protein interaction networks and likely also in gene regulation networks. Such disorder-based signaling is further modulated in multicellular eukaryotes by alternative splicing, for which such splicing events map to regions of disorder much more often than to regions of structure. Associating alternative splicing with disorder rather than structure alleviates theoretical and experimentally observed problems associated with the folding of different length, isomeric amino acid sequences. The combination of disorder and alternative splicing is proposed to provide a mechanism for easily \"trying out\" different signaling pathways, thereby providing the mechanism for generating signaling diversity and enabling the evolution of cell differentiation and multicellularity. Finally, several recent small molecules of interest as potential drugs have been shown to act by blocking protein-protein interactions based on intrinsic disorder of one of the partners. Study of these examples has led to a new approach for drug discovery, and bioinformatics analysis of the human proteome suggests that various disease-associated proteins are very rich in such disorder-based drug discovery targets.",

They exist as ensembles of rapidly fluctuating structures and many undergo coupled folding and binding reactions. Because ID proteins are overrepresented in major disease pathways they are desirable targets for inhibition; however, the feasibility of targeting proteins without defined structures was unclear. Recently, small molecules have been found that bind to the disordered regions of c-Myc, Abeta, EWS-Fli1, and various peptides. As with structured targets, initial hits were further optimized to increase specificity and affinity. Given the number and biological importance of ID proteins, the ability to inhibit their interactions opens tremendous potential in chemical biology and drug discovery.",

One major improvement was an increase in seed number per inflorescence, which enhanced yield and simplified harvesting and storage. The ancestor of maize, teosinte, makes 2 rows of kernels, and modern varieties make \u223c8-20 rows. Kernel rows are initiated by the inflorescence shoot meristem, and shoot meristem size is controlled by a feedback loop involving the CLAVATA signaling proteins and the WUSCHEL transcription factor. We present a hypothesis that variation in inflorescence meristem size affects kernel row number (KRN), with the potential to increase yield. We also show that variation in the CLAVATA receptor-like protein FASCIATED EAR2 leads to increased inflorescence meristem size and KRN. These findings indicate that modulation of fundamental stem cell proliferation control pathways has the potential to enhance crop yields.",

LTP is input-specific at the level of individual synapses, but neural network models predict interactions between plasticity at nearby synapses. Here we show in mouse hippocampal pyramidal cells that LTP at individual synapses reduces the threshold for potentiation at neighbouring synapses. After input-specific LTP induction by two-photon glutamate uncaging or by synaptic stimulation, subthreshold stimuli, which by themselves were too weak to trigger LTP, caused robust LTP and spine enlargement at neighbouring spines. Furthermore, LTP induction broadened the presynaptic-postsynaptic spike interval for spike-timing-dependent LTP within a dendritic neighbourhood.",

This is the result of the mitochondria's central role in energy production, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and cell death. These processes are interdependent and may occur under various stressing conditions, among which low oxygen levels (hypoxia) are certainly prominent. Cells exposed to hypoxia respond acutely with endogenous metabolites and proteins promptly regulating metabolic pathways, but if low oxygen levels are prolonged, cells activate adapting mechanisms, the master switch being the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Activation of this factor is strictly bound to the mitochondrial function, which in turn is related with the oxygen level. Therefore in hypoxia, mitochondria act as [O2] sensors, convey signals to HIF-1 directly or indirectly, and contribute to the cell redox potential, ion homeostasis, and energy production. Although over the last two decades cellular responses to low oxygen tension have been studied extensively, mechanisms underlying these functions are still indefinite.",

Thus, mammalian cells respond to hypoxia by altering COX subunit composition, as previously observed in yeast, but by a completely different molecular mechanism.",

Primarily utilizing pulmonary arterial endothelial cells as a representative hypoxic cell type, we identify the iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins (ISCU1/2) as direct targets for repression by the hypoxia-induced microRNA-210 (miR-210). ISCU1/2 facilitate the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters, prosthetic groups that are critical for electron transport and mitochondrial oxidation-reduction reactions. Under in vivo conditions of upregulating miR-210 and repressing ISCU1/2, the integrity of iron-sulfur clusters is disrupted. In turn, by repressing ISCU1/2 during hypoxia, miR-210 decreases the activity of prototypical iron-sulfur proteins controlling mitochondrial metabolism, including Complex I and aconitase. Consequently, miR-210 represses mitochondrial respiration and associated downstream functions. These results identify important mechanistic connections among microRNA, iron-sulfur cluster biology, hypoxia, and mitochondrial function, with broad implications for cellular metabolism and adaptation to cellular stress.",

Molecular replacement experiments revealed that the LRRTM2 extracellular domain is sufficient for LTP, probably because it mediates binding to neurexins (Nrxs). Examination of surface expression of endogenous AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in cultured neurons suggests that LRRTMs maintain newly delivered AMPARs at synapses after LTP induction. LRRTMs are also required for LTP of mature synapses on adult CA1 pyramidal neurons, indicating that the block of LTP in neonatal synapses by LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 KD is not due to impairment of synapse maturation.",

However, methyl groups, being unable to form hydrogen bonds, are too wide to pass through.",

Discrimination between these similar, abundant ions enables these proteins to control electrical and chemical activity in all organisms. Selection occurs at the narrow selectivity filter containing structurally identified K(+) binding sites. Selectivity is thought to arise because smaller ions such as Na(+) do not bind to these K(+) sites in a thermodynamically favorable way. Using the model K(+) channel KcsA, we examined how intracellular Na(+) and Li(+) interact with the pore and the permeant ions using electrophysiology, molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray crystallography. Our results suggest that these small cations have a separate binding site within the K(+) selectivity filter. We propose that selective permeation from the intracellular side primarily results from a large energy barrier blocking filter entry for Na(+) and Li(+) in the presence of K(+), not from a difference of binding affinity between ions.",

Hairpins directly adjacent to the RNA-DNA hybrid weaken RNAP binding, decrease elongation efficiency, and disrupt the upstream end of the hybrid as well as interfere with the movement of the template base at the RNAP active site. Probing the edges of the DNA transcription bubble demonstrates that termination hairpins prevent translocation of the RNAP, suggesting that they transiently \"lock\" the polymerase to the nucleic acid scaffold and, thus, hold the RNA-DNA hybrid \"in frame.\" At intrinsic terminators the weak rU-dA hybrid and the adjacent termination hairpin combine to destabilize the elongation complex sufficiently to permit significant transcript release, whereas hairpin-dependent pausing provides time for the process to go to completion",

However, numerous studies have shown that most of the renal excretory rhythms persist for long periods of time, even in the absence of periodic environmental cues. These observations led to the hypothesis of the existence of a self-sustained mechanism, enabling the kidney to anticipate various predictable circadian challenges to homeostasis. The molecular basis of this mechanism remained unknown until the recent discovery of the mammalian circadian clock made of a system of autoregulatory transcriptional/translational feedback loops, which have been found in all tissues studied, including the kidney.",

It requires very effective coupling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and regeneration in the working flight muscles. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of locust flight muscle in vivo has shown that flight causes only a small decrease in the content of ATP, whereas the free concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) were estimated to increase by about 3-, 5- and 27-fold, respectively. These metabolites are potent activators of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase (PFK). Activation of glycolysis by AMP and Pi is reinforced synergistically by fructose 2,6-biphosphate (F2,6P2), a very potent activator of PFK. During prolonged flight locusts gradually change from using carbohydrate to lipids as their main fuel. This requires a decrease in glycolytic flux which is brought about, at least in part, by a marked decrease in the content of F2,6P2 in flight muscle (by 80% within 15 min of flight). The synthesis of F2,6P2 in flight muscle can be stimulated by the nervous system via the biogenic amine octopamine. Octopamine and F2,6P2 seem to be part of a mechanism to control the rate of carbohydrate oxidation in flight muscle and thus function in the metabolic integration of insect flight.",

Glycogenolysis does not lead to lactic acid; instead, the end products of glycolysis are pyruvate and alpha-glycerophosphate. The alpha-glycerophosphate cycle provides a mechanism not only for the reoxidation of glycolytically produced NADH but also for the stoicheiometric formation from each molecule of hexose equivalent of two molecules of pyruvate, which are then available for oxidation via the tricarboxylate cycle. The absence of dicarboxylate and tricarboxylate carriers from the mitochondria ensures that tricarboxylate-cycle intermediates do not exit from the mitochondrion but that pyruvate is oxidized to completion. On initiation of flight, mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate is impeded by the lack of tricarboxylate-cycle intermediates for the generation of oxaloacetate. This is circumvented by the oxidation of proline",

Under saturating light, PSII photochemistry was inactivated less and recovered more completely in the black leaves. In full sunlight, green plants branched more abundantly and accumulated shoot biomass quicker than the black plants; in the shade, productivities of the two morphs were comparable. The data indicate a light-screening, photoprotective role of foliar anthocyanins. However, limitations to photosynthetic carbon assimilation are relatively small, insufficient to explain the natural scarcity of black-leafed plants.",

A common theme in the discussions is to explain why photosynthesis appears to absorb less of the available green sunlight than expected. The expectation is incorrect, however, because it fails to take the energy cost of the photosynthetic apparatus into account. Depending on that cost, the red absorption band of the chlorophylls may be closely optimized to provide maximum growth power. The optimization predicts a strong influence of Fraunhofer lines in the solar irradiance on the spectral shape of the optimized absorption band, which appears to be correct. It does not predict any absorption at other wavelengths.",
