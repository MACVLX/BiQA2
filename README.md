# BiQA2
Biomedical corpus for QA systems modelling based on the previously compiled BiQA corpus from LASIGE (https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/BiQA#publication).
IT is comprised of 3 distinct biomedical online foruns. It was conceived as training data for models capable of tackling the Documents and Snippets Retrieval sub tasks of Phase A Task B of the biomedical Question & Answering competition BioASQ. It can also be used for the yes/no exact answer retrieval sub task of the Phase B task B of BioASQ.
